Development - application architecture has been identified and most of the
              functionality has been completed.  The exception is the support 
              of Products which requires work on each project.  
              
              The MVC website requires some cleanup with regard to logging
              exceptions and styling of views.

              The SPA website is just getting started with API and corresponding
              Angular component working to retreive and display basedball card
              data.  Lot's to do here...

Research

- How does the built-in logger work?  Where are log files written? 
  Must add logging to each method in each controller once understood.

- Need to move all styles to CSS file.

Quinlan.SPA - The Single Page Application is just getting started.  I have a
              functioning component in the ClientApp that requests it's data
              from an API method which uses an injected service to retrieve
              data from the domain.

              Note that the Web API is being developed as part of the SPA
              because it is intended to be custom to the SPA.  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Develop API for the single page application

- Cards
- Colleges
- People
- Sports
- Teams

2) Develop Angular components

- cards.component
- colleges.component
- people.component
- teams.component

3) Clean up.

- Remove counter and fetch-data components


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unit Testing - much of the unit testing has been identified but only about 
               a third of those tests have been written.  The remaining work
               is itemized below.

               Need a better strategy for seeding data.  And since data that
               has been imported cannot be protected, the import process
               must be simulated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quinlan.Test

Research

- How should I test controllers in the MVC website and API?
- How should I client-side functionality? With what?
- Do I need integration testing with Selinium or the like?
